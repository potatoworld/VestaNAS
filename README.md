Flat packable, compact form factor server oriented PC Chasis.

This is a project that I undertook to learn more about the sheet metal design space within Fusion 360. This case is meant to be easy to assemble, extremely compact yet still able to hold enough 3.5" HDD's for a large storage array. It stands at 445mm tall and 250mm wide. Utilizes an ITX motherboard, small form factor GPU and a full size ATX PSU. 

I have yet to create a functioning prototype of this project, but do plan to do so in the future with a service like Send Cut Send. Although, the design does need some updating as some fasteners and joints are not as robust as I would like them to be.
